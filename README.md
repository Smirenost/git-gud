## Install

```sh
npm install -g git-gud
```

## Usage

**Highlights:**

- **`$ gud pr`**: 
	- when you're in a project with dozens of `pull requests` it's tiresome to go to github and find which one is yours to check if something new is up, this will find the pull request number in which your current branch and open the page for you. 
- **`$ gud new pr`**: 
	- it's a tedious job to go to github, create new `pull request` and find the branch you've been working on and compare it to `develop`, this will automate it for you based on the branch you're currently on.

```
Usage
$ gud <command>

## Acessing private repositories
If you want to access private repositories all you need to do is to create a **Personal API token** (instructions [here](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens))

Once you got it just export it in your bash/zsh/fish profile.

``` bash
export GIT_GOOD=<your-token-here>
```
